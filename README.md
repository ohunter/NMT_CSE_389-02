# 2018-02-02 : Museum Plan

a)      What is the theme of your museum?

        We have not yet quite decided on the theme of the museum, although we have narrowed it down some amount. We were considering doing something along the lines of a classical art museum, however; we are open to changing the theme.

b)      How many rooms will your museum have?

        Once again, we have not decided quite yet. Ideally, we would like to have as many as we can, but we do not know how difficult it will be to get things working. As such, we are planning on starting with one room and see where to go from there.

c)       Have you started looking for textures for your museum walls/floors? If so, what are your plans?

        Not really, however; from personal experience, high textures are often available online for free and 

d)      Will your museum have a ceiling?

        This will depend on how difficult it is to implement lights as well as the amount of rooms that we have to get working and how much of a struggle that will be.

e)      You must have at least ONE “sculpture” in your museum. What are you planning to use for
 your sculpture(s)?

        Depending on the theme of the museum, the sculpture cen really be anything within the genre that the type of museum we are modeling could specialize in. As such, for classical art we could possibly find a high poly, or low poly depending on what we are going for, model of a lot of renaissance statues which we would be able to import into the scene.

f)       You must have at least FOUR “paintings” in your museum. What were you planning to use for
 your pictures?

        The same as was mentioned above also applies to the paintings.
